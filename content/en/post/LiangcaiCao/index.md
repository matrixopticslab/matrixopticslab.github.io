On February 26, 2026, we were honored to host **Prof. Liangcai Cao** from the Department of Precision Instruments at **Tsinghua University** for an academic seminar titled **"Computational Optics Wavefront Sensing and Phase Imaging Technology."**

Prof. Cao is a renowned expert in holographic display and computational imaging. During his presentation, he shared his group's latest breakthroughs in integrating physical models with neural networks, specifically highlighting:

* **Propagation-Adaptive Holography**: Utilizing physics-constrained spatial and Fourier neural operators to achieve high-fidelity 4K computer-generated holography.
* **Computational Wavefront Sensing**: Implementing high-resolution wavefront characterization for complex wavefields in biological imaging.
* **Physics-Informed Deep Learning**: Applications in adaptive aberration-corrected quantitative phase microscopy to overcome traditional imaging limits.

The seminar sparked extensive discussions among our group members regarding the intersection of **random matrix theory** and **holographic reconstruction**. We sincerely thank Prof. Cao for his profound insights and the valuable academic exchange.
