On March 21, 2025, our group was honored to host **Prof. Xin Yuan** from the School of Engineering at **Westlake University** for an engaging academic seminar titled **"Snapshot Compressive Imaging: From Theory to Applications."**

Prof. Yuan is a leading expert in the field of computational imaging and compressive sensing. During his presentation, he provided a comprehensive overview of his team's significant contributions to **Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI)**, focusing on:

* **Hardware-Algorithm Co-design**: Innovative architectures for capturing high-dimensional data (video, hyperspectral) using 2D detectors through coded apertures.
* **Deep Learning for SCI**: The transition from traditional optimization-based reconstruction to state-of-the-art deep learning models (such as PnP-ADMM and Transformers) for real-time, high-quality recovery.
* **Clinical and Industrial Applications**: How SCI technology is revolutionizing ultra-high-speed photography and biomedical imaging, providing new tools for observing fast-evolving biological processes.

The seminar concluded with an interactive session where members of the **Random Matrix Optics Research Group (RMORG)** discussed the potential of combining SCI with **statistical optics** to tackle deep-tissue imaging challenges. We extend our gratitude to Prof. Yuan for sharing his visionary work.
