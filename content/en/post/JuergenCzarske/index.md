On October 9, 2025, we were honored to host **Prof. [cite_start]Juergen Czarske** from the **Dresden University of Technology (TUD)**, Germany, for an inspiring academic seminar titled **"Deep Holography, Quantum Imaging and Lensless 3D Endomicroscopy towards Advances in Biomedicine"**[cite: 1, 3].

[cite_start]Prof. Czarske is a Fellow of OPTICA, SPIE, and several other prestigious societies, and the recipient of the 2024 SPIE Dennis Gabor Award in Diffractive Optics[cite: 13, 15]. [cite_start]During the seminar, he presented a paradigm shift in biomedical imaging, moving from traditional bulky lens-based systems to **lensless fiber endoscopes** enabled by **computational imaging**[cite: 7, 8]. Key highlights included:

* **Physics-Informed Deep Learning**: Exploiting speckle patterns to achieve high-fidelity 3D imaging and **virtual staining** of cancer cells[cite: 8, 9, 10].
* [cite_start]**Quantum Imaging Perspectives**: Discussing the potential of using entangled photons and teleportation for advanced biomedical sensing[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Clinical Potential**: How these advancements can detect and prevent disease development through early and gentle diagnostics[cite: 6].

[cite_start]The presentation sparked deep discussions on the intersection of **deep holography** and our group's work in random matrix theory[cite: 12]. [cite_start]We thank Prof. Czarske for his insightful talk and for fostering international academic exchange between TUD, SIOM, and our laboratory[cite: 3, 5].
