On December 4, 2025, our group was honored to host **Prof. [cite_start]Zhihua Ding** from the College of Optical Science and Engineering at **Zhejiang University** for an academic seminar titled **"Optical Coherence Tomography: Technology and Applications"**.

[cite_start]Prof. Ding is a distinguished expert in biomedical photonics, with extensive research experience at institutions such as Shizuoka University and the Beckman Laser Institute at UC Irvine. [cite_start]During the seminar, he discussed the transformative potential of **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)** as a label-free, high-resolution, and high-speed 3D imaging modality for both biomedical and industrial sectors. Key highlights of his presentation included:

* **Ultra-deep 3D OCT Imaging**: Latest research achievements in achieving superior imaging depth within highly turbid media.
* [cite_start]**Clinical Diagnostics**: Progress in utilizing fiber-probe-based quantitative OCT for the detection of cervical cancer.
* [cite_start]**System Innovation**: Development of advanced multimodal systems, such as intravascular ultrasound-OCT endoscopes and multi-scale brain imaging devices.

[cite_start]The session concluded with an engaging discussion on breaking the current limits of optical imaging depth to open new frontiers in scientific research and medical applications. [cite_start]We thank Prof. Ding for his inspiring presentation and his contribution to the advancement of OCT technologies.
