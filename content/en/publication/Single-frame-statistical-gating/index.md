abstract: "We demonstrate a single-frame statistical gating method to separate single and multiple scattering components from a single-shot speckle pattern. By analyzing the local statistics of intensity fluctuations in the speckle generated by a dynamic disordered medium, we show that the gated multiple scattering component can facilitate the extraction of absorption information for deep-tissue imaging."
